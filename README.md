# progressiveBudget

A basic budgeting app with offline functionality.

# Description

This is a basic budget tracking app. While functionality was fully developed,
I added offline capability through the IndexDB API so that transactions could
be continuously recorded regardless of connectivity.

# Technologies Used

IndexDB

# Usage

When a user enters information to record a transaction for their budget, that transaction is recorded. If the user is offline, the transaction is stored locally until connectivity is back online.
